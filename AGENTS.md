## Build & Verify Commands

```bash
# Full CI pipeline (matches .github/workflows/ci.yml order)
cargo fmt --check --all
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Single crate
cargo test --package nca-core
cargo test --package nca-common

# Single test
cargo test --package nca-core -- test_name

# Install after build
cargo build --release && cp target/release/nca /usr/local/bin/

# Dev run (debug)
cargo run -p nca-cli
```

A pre-commit hook (auto-installed by `cargo-husky` on first `cargo test`) runs `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo fmt -- --check` before every commit — so commits are slow and will fail if any of those fail. To bypass locally use `git commit --no-verify` (CI still enforces the same checks). CI runs on push to all branches and PRs to all branches.

No `rust-toolchain.toml` or `rustfmt.toml` — CI pins stable channel via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`; formatting and linting use Rust defaults.

## Workspace Structure

5 crates, edition 2024, version 0.3.0:

```
common  ← leaf crate, no internal deps. Shared types: config, events, messages, tool schemas, model capabilities.
core    ← depends on common only. Agent loop, Provider trait, tool registry, harness, skills, approvals.
runtime ← depends on common + core. Supervisor, IPC, session persistence, worktrees, PTY.
cli     ← depends on all above. Binary entrypoint, TUI, REPL, stream rendering.
autoresearch ← depends on common only (parallel to core). Metric-driven research helpers.
```

Dependency direction is strictly `cli → runtime → core → common` and `cli → autoresearch → common`. Never reverse this. `autoresearch` and `core` are siblings — neither depends on the other.

Key UI dependencies in `cli`: `ratatui 0.30` + `crossterm 0.29` (TUI), `reedline 0.38` (REPL), `syntect 5` (syntax highlighting), `pulldown-cmark 0.12` (markdown rendering), `arboard 3` (clipboard).

## Provider Architecture

All LLM calls go through the `Provider` trait in `core::provider`. Provider modules:
`deepseek` (default), `minimax`, `minimax_vlm` (vision-language model), `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `zhipuai`.

Infrastructure modules in the same directory:
- `factory.rs` — provider instantiation from config.
- `openai_compat` / `anthropic_compat` — shared SSE stream parsers for their respective formats.
- `test_support.rs` / `validate.rs` — test harness helpers and provider config validation.

- `core` depends on `genai 0.5` (multi-provider LLM library) and `rmcp 1.7` (MCP client).
- `prepare_messages_for_request()` is the hook for provider-specific message rewriting (e.g. DeepSeek strips `reasoning_content`).
- Never hard-code a model name. Always read from config (`common::config::NcaConfig`).
- Empty completions must fail loudly (never silently succeed).

## Agent Profiles

Agent profiles allow per-agent overrides of provider, model, permission mode, system prompt, and tool gating. They are defined in config under `[agents.<name>]` and also auto-registered from skill frontmatter.

**Config-defined profiles** (`config.toml` / `config.local.toml`):

```toml
[agents.code-reviewer]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4o"
permission_mode = "plan"
system_prompt_append = "Focus on security and correctness."
allowed_tools = ["read", "search", "list_directory"]
```

**Skill-based profiles:** Skills with `agent: true` in frontmatter (or known OMO specialist names: `explorer`, `oracle`, `librarian`, `designer`, `fixer`, `tester`, `observer`, `council`) are auto-registered as agent profiles at supervisor startup via `register_skill_agents()`. Explicit `[agents.<name>]` config entries take precedence over skill-discovered profiles.

**Built-in OMO specialists:** Seeded into the user's XDG skills directory on startup via `nca_common::builtin_skills::seed_builtin_skills()`. These provide the seven specialist personas used for subagent delegation.

**Runtime switching:** `Supervisor::apply_agent_profile(name)` rebuilds the LLM provider, system prompt, permission mode, and tool registry. The `@orchestrator` profile (index 0) restores the default harness prompt with no overrides. Tab cycling in the REPL/TUI rotates through the full profile list.

Key types:
- `AgentProfileConfig` (`common::config`) — the profile override struct.
- `build_system_prompt_with_agent()` (`core::harness`) — system prompt builder that swaps in the agent's `system_prompt` when set, otherwise uses the built-in.
- `ToolRegistry::restrict_to()` (`core::tools`) — tool gating when `allowed_tools` is set.

## Key Conventions

- **Rust-native only.** No JavaScript, Node.js, Electron, Tauri, or webview frameworks in any crate.
- **All I/O is async** via tokio. Never call blocking I/O on the async runtime; use `spawn_blocking` if unavoidable.
- **Error handling:** library crates use `thiserror`. Application code (`cli`) may use `anyhow`. Never `.unwrap()` in library code. Narrow exception: `.expect()` is allowed only in application startup code for reading required config (e.g. `main.rs`).
- **Visibility:** default to `pub(crate)`, promote to `pub` only when another crate needs it. All public types and traits must have doc comments.
- **Tests:** inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in source files. Integration tests in `crates/cli/tests/`. Use `tempfile` for filesystem tests. Never depend on network access in tests—mock the `Provider` trait. `core` has a `tiny_http` dev-dependency for mock HTTP servers in tests. `cli` uses `insta` for TUI snapshot tests.
- **Channels:** prefer `tokio::sync::mpsc`. Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` only when multiple independent consumers need the same stream.
- **Tool execution:** shell commands must go through `runtime::pty` (isolated process group + streaming stdout + whole-group cleanup on completion/timeout, so a backgrounded child can never pin a worker or starve the TUI input loop). Don't bypass it with ad-hoc `Command` usage for user-visible execution. File write tools must canonicalize paths and verify they are within the workspace root or any mounted extra path. External directories can be mounted at runtime via `/mount <path>`; mounted paths are also granted rw in the Landlock policy (refreshed live on `/mount`/`/unmount`) so shell visibility matches file-tool visibility — opt out via `[permissions.sandbox] inherit_mounts = false`.
- **Tool-use streaming:** incoming tool-use blocks are buffered until the closing tag is received, then executed as a batch (not streamed incrementally).
- **IPC:** newline-delimited JSON over Unix domain sockets. `AgentEvent` enum is the shared event bus.
- **Sessions:** `<workspace>/.nca/sessions/<id>.json` (snapshot cache) + `<id>.events.jsonl` (authoritative event log). Resume folds `MessageRecorded` events via `core::replay` (P2 Phase B replay-authoritative; old-format logs fall back to json). `EventLogWriter` fsyncs at each `TurnCompleted` and `run_turn` awaits that commit before returning. The session json is single-writer: written only by the owning `Supervisor` at create/resume/finish; lineage (`child_session_ids`) is folded from `ChildSessionSpawned` envelopes at resume. IPC socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nca/` (fallback `/tmp/nca/`).
- **Config resolution:** compiled defaults → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nca/config.toml` → `<workspace>/.nca/config.local.toml` → env vars → CLI flags.
- **Conventional Commits** for commit messages (type(scope): description).
- **Do not edit `for-test/`** — it is gitignored and used for transient test artifacts.
- **Doc sync (same commit):** adding/removing deps → update `docs/tech-stack.md`; changing crate boundaries → update `docs/architecture.md`; changing MVP scope → update `docs/prd.md`.

## Context & Cost Guardrails

The system has several size guards to prevent context window overflow:

- Tool output truncated at 32KB (head+tail strategy) in `agent.rs::truncate_tool_output`.
- `list_directory` capped at 1000 entries.
- Skill descriptions clipped to 120 chars in system prompt index.
- Skills index capped at 4000 chars in `harness.rs`.
- `reasoning_content` from DeepSeek is stripped before re-upload (response-only signal, ~500 tokens saved per turn).
- Cost tracker includes cache token accounting (cache_read priced at 1/50 of normal input).

## TUI Architecture

The TUI runs a **dual-write bridge** (`tui/bridge.rs`) that fans out each `AgentEvent` to:
1. `TuiSessionState` (legacy mutable state in `state.rs`) — still used by the `cmd_rx` loop in `repl.rs` for synchronous reads.
2. `TuiFeedbackMsg` channel → `NcaModel` (Elm architecture in `tui/elm/`) — the actual renderer.

The Elm TUI (`tui/elm/model.rs::NcaModel`) runs inside `spawn_blocking` on a dedicated thread with its own tick/update/view loop. It owns all rendering, input handling, and component state. All events flow through `TuiFeedbackChannel` → `TuiFeedbackMsg` channel → `NcaModel::apply_event`. The legacy `app.rs::run_blocking()` and `TuiSessionState` dual-write are no longer used.

**Question-answer bypass:** While `run_turn` blocks on `ask_question`'s oneshot channel, the main `cmd_rx` loop never receives `TuiCmd::Submit` or `QuestionAnswer`. Answers must flow through the `question_answer_tx` side channel (set up in `repl.rs`). The Elm composer routes Enter keypresses through this channel when `active_question` is set.

**Dead-code suppression:** The legacy `app.rs` has `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `TuiCmd` and `ApprovalAnswer` variants. `tui/elm/mod.rs` has `#![allow(dead_code, unused_imports)]`. Do not remove `#[allow]` annotations without verifying the item is truly dead. `TuiSessionState` in `state.rs` is retained only for tests and the legacy `replay_event_log_into_state` helper.

**Shared state between Elm and runtime:** Uses `Arc<StdMutex<...>>` (not tokio::Mutex) because Elm runs on a blocking thread. Key shared handles: `active_question_id`, `active_question_payload`, `staged_images`.

**Tracing in TUI mode:** When the full-screen TUI is active, tracing output is redirected to `<workspace>/.nca/nca.log` instead of stderr to avoid corrupting the display. The `TuiFileWriter` in `main.rs` implements `MakeWriter` for this. Non-TUI runs (REPL, one-shot, `--stream ndjson`) continue to use stderr. User-visible errors flow through `AgentEvent` → transcript, not tracing.

## TUI & IPC Performance

- Ratatui rendering must use `is_dirty()` guards to skip frames when nothing changed — without this, idle CPU stays at 7%+ instead of target <1%. The Elm architecture has a `redraw` guard and `BlockLineCache` for incremental rendering.
- IPC channels must be bounded (buffer=100) to prevent unbounded message accumulation.
- Use `Vec::with_capacity` when size is known at allocation time.
- When the Landlock sandbox confines a PTY command, its environment is cleared and only an allowlisted set of variables (PATH, HOME, TERM, cargo/toolchain vars, any `LC_*`) passes through; the list is configurable via `[permissions.sandbox] env_allow` in config.

## System Dependencies

Linux builds require `libssl-dev`, `pkg-config`, and `ripgrep`. macOS builds may need the Homebrew equivalents.

The Landlock command sandbox (P5) needs a Linux kernel with Landlock (5.13+ for basic support; CI's ubuntu 6.8+ is fine). No extra packages required — it is a kernel LSM. On unsupported kernels `sandbox = "auto"` (default) degrades to unconfined with a warn-once notice; `"required"` fails closed.

## MCP Tools

MCP servers are loaded via `rmcp` crate (v1.7, features: `client`, `transport-async-rw`). `load_mcp_tools()` is async—callers must await. MCP tool results go through the same `truncate_tool_output` guardrail as built-in tools.

## System Prompt Layering

Built in `core::harness::build_system_prompt_with_agent` (accepts an optional `AgentProfileConfig` that can replace the built-in prompt with a specialist persona):
1. Built-in harness prompt
2. Permission-mode guidance
3. Global Instructions (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nca/AGENTS.md`, user-level)
4. `AGENTS.md` (workspace repo-level instructions)
5. `.ncarc` (committed project instructions, if present)
6. `.nca/instructions.md` (local instructions)
7. Discovered skills summary
8. Orchestration context (`NCA_ORCH_*` env vars)
